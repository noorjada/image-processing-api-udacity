# image-processing-api-udacity

## Project Description

This project is a Node.js + Express API built with TypeScript that dynamically resizes images using the Sharp library.

The API serves two main purposes:

1. Acts as a simple placeholder image service for frontend prototyping.
2. Dynamically resizes existing images and caches them to improve performance and reduce processing time.

The project demonstrates scalable architecture, TypeScript usage, unit testing, linting, formatting, and caching.
